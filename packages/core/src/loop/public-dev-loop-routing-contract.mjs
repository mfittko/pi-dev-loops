/**
 * Public dev-loop façade routing contract.
 *
 * This evaluator models the first-slice public entrypoint contract from issue #86:
 * - one public entrypoint: `dev-loop`
 * - one canonical current-state shape
 * - deterministic routing to internal strategy families
 * - no legacy compatibility entrypoint projection in routed results
 *
 * The evaluator is intentionally pure and side-effect free. It does not inspect
 * GitHub or local state itself; callers may provide the authoritative current
 * state they have already detected, or omit it for explicit start intents where
 * the router can synthesize a minimal canonical state from the requested target.
