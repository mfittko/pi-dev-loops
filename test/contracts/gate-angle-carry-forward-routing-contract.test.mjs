// Angle carry-forward is a fail-closed decision seam with a CLI, a surface map,
// and a provenance shape — all of it inert unless an operational procedure step
// actually routes to it. Before this guard, the rule lived only in the contract
// doc, so every gate round re-dispatched every angle and the seam was never
// invoked once.
//
// These assertions pin the ROUTING in place: the skill that drives the fan-out
// must name the CLI, dispatch only the angles it leaves to re-run, record the
// carried ones with their carried provenance, and treat a CLI refusal as
// "re-run everything" rather than "re-run nothing". Each pattern group is
// matched against the SPECIFIC numbered step it governs (extracted by its
// heading), not the whole file — a bare header/Phase-3 mention of a token like
// `carriedFromHead` must not satisfy a check that exists to pin Phase 1.2.
