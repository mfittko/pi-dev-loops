// foreign-owned PR proceeds (no gate block); a fix/merge route on the same
// foreign PR is still blocked" AC was backed only by the doc-grep test
// "standalone review route stays structurally decoupled..." below). This test
// drives the REAL routing/exemption logic with one foreign-owned PR fixture,
// both halves in one test so the DIFFERENTIAL itself is the pinned contract:
//
//   half A — the review pipeline's Phase-1 entrypoint (write-gate-context.mjs
//   --gate review, the first stage every /loop-review run executes) PROCEEDS
//   on a foreign-owned PR and never resolves a viewer identity: makeGhMock
//   answers the spec-of-record PR read (plus any legitimate closing-issue
//   reads) and fails closed (exit 97) on any extra unstubbed gh call, so
//   wiring `gh api user` (or any viewer-identity read) into write-gate-context
//   fails this test loudly. (Phase 3 of the review pipeline — the verdict
//   poster — DOES read `gh api user` for marker provenance; that is a
//   different, exempt mechanism, NOT the ownership gate's.)
//
//   half B — the write/merge startup route (resolve-dev-loop-startup.mjs
//   --pr, the single-contributor ownership gate) on the SAME foreign-owned
//   fixture fails closed naming the foreign assignee.
