# Gate-Review Sub-Loop Contract

This document defines the reusable checkpoint review chain execution shape shared by the
two dev-loop gate boundaries: `draft_gate` and `pre_approval_gate`.

## Purpose

Both gates share the same execution mechanism: a structured sub-loop that provides
isolation, fresh-reviewer fan-out, fan-in synthesis, and iterative fix-then-retry.
Codifying the sub-loop once as a shared contract avoids inconsistent execution.

This contract owns the **execution shape** of gate-review work. It does not own:
- which review angles a specific gate runs (that stays in the skill)
- the visible gate-review PR comment format (owned by [Gate Review Comment Contract](./gate-review-comment-contract.md))
- the broader PR lifecycle sequencing (owned by the workflow skill and [PR Lifecycle Contract](../skills/docs/pr-lifecycle-contract.md))

## Relationship to the checkpoint verdict comment contract

The sub-loop executes the review work. The checkpoint verdict comment contract
([Gate Review Comment Contract](gate-review-comment-contract.md)) defines the visible PR comment evidence that
proves the sub-loop completed for a specific head SHA. Both are required for a gate to
be satisfied, but they address different concerns:
- this contract = **how** the review work is structured and executed
- checkpoint verdict comment contract = **what** visible evidence must exist on the PR

## Separate chains per gate

Each gate (`draft_gate`, `pre_approval_gate`) runs its own independent review chain
with its own review angles, its own disposition ledger, its own fix cycle, and its own
exit conditions. The chains are not interchangeable; each gate's execution is a complete,
self-contained sub-loop pass.

| Property | `draft_gate` chain | `pre_approval_gate` chain |
|---|---|---|
| Review angles | Resolved from `gates.draft.angles` | Resolved from `gates.preApproval.angles` |
| Disposition ledger | Gate-specific findings log | Gate-specific findings log |
| Fix cycle scope | Only findings that block the draft→ready transition | Only findings that block final approval readiness |
| Exit condition | Clean verdict for the reviewed head | Clean verdict for the reviewed head |

## Sub-loop phases

The sub-loop is a single reusable shape. Both gates run it with their own review angles,
but the execution phases are identical.

### Phase 1 — Preamble: context-builder

Before fanning out reviewers, run a preamble pass that produces review handoff context
on an isolated checkout:

- fresh context (do not fork the parent session just to share chat history). **Mandatory:** every gate-review subagent must run `scripts/github/verify-fresh-review-context.mjs` at startup and refuse to proceed on contamination. Use `--scope <angle>` so each reviewer writes its own sentinel.
- `worktree: true` recommended per reviewer/subagent for filesystem isolation; prescribe it but
  do not fail closed if worktrees are unavailable in the current environment
- the preamble produces one or more review handoff artifacts (branch, head SHA, PR/issue
  scope, acceptance criteria, touched files, validation posture)
- reference the pi-subagents `parallel context-build` technique when applicable:
  run parallel `context-builder` agents from fresh context with distinct output paths
  (e.g. `context-build/request-and-scope.md`, `context-build/codebase-and-patterns.md`,
  `context-build/validation-and-risks.md`) and synthesize the outputs into the review
  handoff artifacts

### Phase 2 — Fork fan-out: parallel reviewers

Fan out one fresh-context reviewer per gate-specific review angle. Each reviewer:

- starts in fresh context (do not inherit prior conversation state). **Mandatory:** run `scripts/github/verify-fresh-review-context.mjs --scope <angle>` at startup; refuse to proceed on contamination. Use `--scope` so parallel reviewers in the same working directory do not trigger false contamination from each other's sentinels.
- receives a concise briefing summary from the preamble handoff artifacts
- is scoped to exactly one review angle
- is **read-only**: inspects the diff and returns findings via output artifacts only; never edits files
- runs in an isolated worktree when worktrees are available
- produces a focused findings artifact with verdict (clean/findings_present) and file references

Reviewers run in parallel when practical. If parallel execution is impractical
(for example due to tooling or resource constraints), run all reviewers sequentially
and explicitly record why parallel execution was impractical.

**Re-run rule:** In subsequent retry cycles (Phase 5), only re-run reviewers that
produced `findings_present` in the previous pass. Reviewers that returned `clean`
don't need re-review unless their angle's scope overlaps with the fix changes.

### Phase 3 — Consolidation: fan-in synthesis and disposition ledger

Merge the parallel reviewer findings into one consolidated fix plan using a
consolidation pass (not manual concatenation):

- collate findings from all review angles
- classify each finding: `must-fix`, `worth-fixing-now`, `defer`
- write the disposition ledger: every finding receives a severity classification and a
  disposition (accepted-for-fix, deferred, disputed, or operator_acknowledged). The disposition ledger is the
  durable record of what the gate found and what was decided.
- produce a merged findings artifact
- determine the overall gate verdict:
  - `clean`: no findings with a severity in the gate's `blockCleanOnFindingSeverities` list remain
  - `findings_present`: one or more findings with a blocking severity remain
  - `blocked`: the gate could not complete or a hard blocker prevented a verdict
- write the durable final-findings log via `write-gate-findings-log.mjs` under
  deterministic `tmp/` paths before posting the visible PR comment

**Disposition ledger rule:** The consolidated findings and their dispositions must be
logged as the durable disposition ledger **before** the visible PR comment is posted.
The ledger is the source of truth for what the gate found; the visible PR comment is a
summary for auditability.

**Post-findings rule:** The consolidated findings must be posted as a visible
PR comment (via the checkpoint verdict comment contract) **before** the fix cycle in
Phase 4 begins. Fixes must not be applied until the auditable trail exists on
the PR.

### Phase 4 — Fix

If findings with a severity in the gate's `blockCleanOnFindingSeverities` list are present:

- apply only the accepted narrow fixes on the same branch
- do not broaden scope or touch unrelated files
- run the smallest honest validation for the accepted fix scope
- commit and push fixes on the branch
- the fix cycle covers **all** blocking severities, not only `must-fix`. If
  `blockCleanOnFindingSeverities` includes `worth-fixing-now`, then worth-fixing-now
  findings must also be fixed before the gate can reach `clean`.

### Phase 5 — Repeat until clean

After applying fixes and advancing the head SHA:

- **Re-gate is mandatory:** a new head SHA always requires a fresh full-chain gate pass. Never skip the gate because a previous head was clean.
- rerun the sub-loop from Phase 1 (context-builder preamble for the new head SHA)
- continue the fix-then-retry cycle until the synthesis verdict is `clean`
- on retry, only re-invoke reviewers that previously returned `findings_present`; the context-builder and consolidation always run fresh
- a clean pass means all gate-specific review angles pass and no findings with a severity in `blockCleanOnFindingSeverities` remain

## Exit conditions

Each gate chain exits when one of these conditions is met:

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| Consolidated verdict is `clean` (no findings at any blocking severity) | Gate passes; proceed to next boundary |
| `blocked` verdict (gate could not complete) | Stop; escalate to operator |
| Maximum retry cycles exhausted without reaching `clean` | Stop; escalate to operator |
| Fix cycle produces no net progress (same findings after fix attempt) | Stop; escalate to operator |

## Machine-parseable fields

The sub-loop execution shape can be referenced programmatically via these fields:

| Field | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `subLoopPhases` | `[preamble, fanout, fanin, fix, repeat]` | Ordered sub-loop phases |
| `contextBuilderRequired` | `true` | Preamble phase must include fresh-context context-builder |
| `worktreeRecommended` | `true` | Worktree isolation recommended but not hard-required |
| `fixRetryUntilClean` | `true` | Blocking-severity findings trigger fix → retry until synthesis is clean |
| `separateChains` | `true` | Each gate runs an independent chain with its own disposition ledger |

## Gate-specific configuration

Each gate configures the sub-loop with its own review angles and blocking severities.
The execution phases are identical; only the review angles and blocking severity policy differ.

| Gate | Review angles | Blocking severities | Owned by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `draft_gate` | Resolved from config (`resolveGateAngles(config, "draft")`) | Resolved from config (`resolveGateConfig(config, "draft").blockCleanOnFindingSeverities`) | [Copilot PR Follow-up Skill](../skills/copilot-pr-followup/SKILL.md) |
| `pre_approval_gate` | Resolved from config (`resolveGateAngles(config, "preApproval")`) | Resolved from config (`resolveGateConfig(config, "preApproval").blockCleanOnFindingSeverities`) | [Copilot PR Follow-up Skill](../skills/copilot-pr-followup/SKILL.md) |

## Non-substitution rule

A clean sub-loop pass for one gate does not satisfy the other gate. Each gate requires
its own complete sub-loop execution with its own review angles, its own disposition ledger,
and its own visible checkpoint verdict comment on the PR for the reviewed head SHA.

## Disposition ledger and durable logging

Every gate pass writes a durable final-findings log via `write-gate-findings-log.mjs`:

```sh
node scripts/github/write-gate-findings-log.mjs \
  --repo <owner/name> \
  --pr <number> \
  --gate <draft_gate|pre_approval_gate> \
  --head-sha <sha> \
  --verdict <clean|findings_present|blocked> \
  --findings '[{"severity":"must-fix","angle":"scope","summary":"...","disposition":"accepted-for-fix"}]'
```

The log is written under `tmp/gate-findings/<repo-slug>/pr-<N>/<gate>-<headSha>.json`.
Each log entry records the full disposition: severity, angle, summary, affected files, and
resolved-in SHA (for findings resolved in a later pass).
