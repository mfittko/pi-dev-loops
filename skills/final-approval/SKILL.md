# Final Approval (redirect)

This route now uses [Copilot PR Follow-up Skill](../copilot-pr-followup/SKILL.md) as the canonical procedure owner.

When the public router selects `final_approval`, load [Copilot PR Follow-up Skill](../copilot-pr-followup/SKILL.md)
and follow its **Final approval gate** section inside Step 7.

Use this redirect only as a narrowed read-set pointer for the routed `final_approval` strategy.
Do not restate merge-ready preconditions, gate evidence rules, or merge authorization policy here.
