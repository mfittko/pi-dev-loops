# Extension scaffold

`pi-dev-loops` ships a lightweight package extension for readiness UX plus one bounded local UI lifecycle seam.

Installing the package exposes two thin wrappers over one shared deterministic core:
- the Pi extension command family rooted at `/dev-loops`
- the shell CLI entrypoint `pi-dev-loops`

Installing the package with `pi install git:github.com/mfittko/pi-dev-loops` exposes the packaged skills through `package.json` `pi.skills`, and the extension syncs packaged agent files (`.pi/agents/*.agent.md`) into `~/.agents/` on `session_start`.

## Command surface

- `/dev-loops`
  - defaults to help output for the available subcommands
- `/dev-loops status`
  - concise readiness summary plus lightweight next steps
- `/dev-loops doctor`
  - full diagnostic report with explicit pass/fail detail
- `/dev-loops hide`
  - removes the readiness widget cleanly
- `/dev-loops inspect open [--repo <owner/name>]`
  - start or reuse the managed local inspect-run viewer and best-effort open it in the browser
- `/dev-loops inspect resume [--repo <owner/name>]`
  - reattach only to a confirmed live managed inspect-run viewer; fails closed when nothing live is managed
- `/dev-loops inspect status [--repo <owner/name>]`
  - report one bounded local lifecycle state plus the current URL when known
- `/dev-loops inspect stop [--repo <owner/name>]`
  - stop only the recorded managed inspect-run viewer process
- `/dev-loops inspect restart [--repo <owner/name>]`
  - explicitly restart the recorded managed inspect-run viewer; never kill an unknown listener
- `pi-dev-loops`
  - defaults to help output for the available subcommands
- `pi-dev-loops help`
  - prints shell help for the shared command family
- `pi-dev-loops status`
  - prints the concise readiness summary in shell-friendly output
- `pi-dev-loops doctor`
  - prints the full diagnostic report in shell-friendly output
- `pi-dev-loops gates`
  - prints active review angles with their prompts from config
- `/dev-loops gates`
  - same as above, but inside the Pi extension
- `pi-dev-loops hide`
  - is intentionally unsupported and exits non-zero with a shell-friendly stderr message because `hide` is session-local Pi UI behavior

## Inspect local UI lifecycle ownership

This slice is intentionally narrow.

Extension-owned behavior:
- operator-facing lifecycle UX under `/dev-loops inspect ...`
- repo-local managed-instance record at `.pi/ui-servers/inspect-run-viewer.json`
- safe URL discovery, liveness checks, resume/reattach, stop, and explicit restart handling
- best-effort browser open
- fail-closed handling for stale ownership and unknown listeners

Viewer-script-owned behavior:
- HTTP server implementation
- viewer HTML/JS rendering
- inbox and query-state behavior
- snapshot loading through the existing adapter
- read-only route behavior and localhost safety rules

Lifecycle states reported by the extension-managed seam are intentionally bounded to:
- `running`
- `stopped`
- `stale_record`
- `conflict_unmanaged_listener`

Guard rails for this seam:
- loopback-first local-only posture
- no remote/public hosting
- no generic local app platform
- no background watcher/supervisor behavior
- no inspect-run viewer redesign

## Current readiness checks

The extension currently reports on:
- `gh` installed
- `gh` authenticated
- `subagent` command available
- inside a git repository

Readiness and help messaging should lead with `dev-loop` as the single public workflow entrypoint. Internal compatibility seams may still exist for runtime/routing purposes, but the readiness surface should not present them as separate user-facing checks or workflow choices.

The messaging distinguishes between local loop readiness and remote GitHub/Copilot readiness. Missing `gh` or `gh auth` blocks remote-loop readiness, but does not imply that local phase-based work is completely unavailable.

## Package install contract for this phase

- `pi install git:github.com/mfittko/pi-dev-loops` is the distribution mechanism for the extension, skills, scripts, packaged agents, and required installed runtime contract docs
- `pi install -l git:github.com/mfittko/pi-dev-loops` is the project-local replacement for the old `install repo` flow
- `pi update git:github.com/mfittko/pi-dev-loops` refreshes an installed package
- source-tree canonical contract docs live under `skills/docs/`; installer/package output must ship this shared docs bundle with the installed skills subtree: [Public Dev Loop Contract](../skills/docs/public-dev-loop-contract.md) and [Retrospective Checkpoint Contract](../skills/docs/retrospective-checkpoint-contract.md)
- installed skill/runtime guidance must read those bundled shared docs (from installed `skills/<skill>/`, resolve via `../docs/`) instead of assuming a source checkout is present; a missing bundled contract doc is a packaging/installer bug
- packaged agents are refreshed into `~/.agents/` on each `session_start`
- `/dev-loops install ...` and `/dev-loops update ...` are removed; use `pi install` / `pi update` directly instead

## Configuration

The dev-loop workflow is driven by a YAML config at `.pi/dev-loop/defaults.yaml` (shipped with the package) and an optional consumer settings file at `.pi/dev-loop/settings.yaml` (the loader also accepts `.pi/dev-loop/settings.yml` and `.pi/dev-loop/settings.json`; legacy `overrides.*` still load as fallbacks).

### How consumers customize config

Create `.pi/dev-loop/settings.yaml` in your project repo. It merges on top of the shipped defaults. If you prefer, the loader also accepts `.pi/dev-loop/settings.yml` and `.pi/dev-loop/settings.json`. You can override any section, including workflow policy defaults:

```yaml
# Example: add a custom review angle with a dedicated persona agent
gates:
  preApproval:
    angles:
      - dry
      - kiss
      - yagni
      - security    # your custom angle

personas:
  security:
    persona: security-reviewer
    prompt: >-
      Audit for auth bypasses, secret leaks, insecure defaults,
      unsafe command execution, and data exposure risks.
    defaultModel: null

  # Override an existing angle's prompt
  dry:
    persona: review
    prompt: >-
      Flag duplication. In this repo, also check for duplicated
      contract language across docs/ and skills/.
    defaultModel: null

# Override gate requirements
refinement:
  fanOut: 5      # run 5 parallel review variants instead of 3

autonomy:
  stopAt:
    - draft-pr
    - merge        # stop for confirmation at both gates

workflow:
  requireRetrospective: true
  requireDraftFirst: true
  devModeDefault: true
```

### Available review angles

The shipped defaults activate these angles. Additional angles are available as opt-in — add them to your `gates.draft.angles` or `gates.preApproval.angles` and they'll use the prompts defined in the personas registry.

| Default (active) | Opt-in (add to gates) |
|---|---|
| `dry` — duplication | `ocp` — Open/Closed (extension over modification) |
| `kiss` — over-engineering | `lsp` — Liskov Substitution (subtype contracts) |
| `yagni` — speculative features | `isp` — Interface Segregation (fat interfaces) |
| `srp` — Single Responsibility | `dip` — Dependency Inversion (abstractions) |
| `soc` — Separation of Concerns | |
| `scope` — scope compliance (draft gate) | |
| `coverage` — test coverage (draft gate) | |
| `correctness` — acceptance criteria (draft gate) | |

### Workflow defaults

The optional `workflow` family carries repo-level workflow posture without hardcoding it into prose-only guidance. Shipped defaults stay permissive:

```yaml
workflow:
  requireRetrospective: false
  requireDraftFirst: false
  devModeDefault: false
```

- `requireRetrospective` — when enabled by repo settings, the next qualifying GitHub-first async start/resume must honor the retrospective checkpoint gate
- `requireDraftFirst` — marks draft-first PR creation as required workflow policy for repos that opt in
- `devModeDefault` — declares that local implementation should default to formal dev mode; this is config-only for now and establishes source-of-truth config plus docs for future runtime consumers

### Config precedence

1. Built-in defaults (`packages/core/src/config/schema.mjs` `BUILT_IN_DEFAULTS`)
2. Shipped defaults (`.pi/dev-loop/defaults.yaml` — committed in source repo)
3. Consumer settings (`.pi/dev-loop/settings.yaml` — preferred repo-local policy surface; `.pi/dev-loop/settings.yml` and `.pi/dev-loop/settings.json` also load; legacy `overrides.*` still load as fallbacks)

### Adding custom review angles

1. Add the angle name to `gates.draft.angles` or `gates.preApproval.angles`
2. Add a `personas.<angle>` entry with a `persona` agent name and a `prompt` instruction
3. Create the corresponding `Agent file` (`.pi/agents/<persona>.agent.md`) if using a new persona
4. Optionally set a per-angle model override via `models.roles.<angle>`

### Config format

YAML is preferred (`.yaml`). JSON (`.json`) is supported as a fallback for backward compatibility. When both exist, YAML takes priority.

Config is validated at runtime by Zod schemas (`packages/core/src/config/schema.mjs`).

## Runtime / build / test contract

Current Phase 3+ contract:
- Node runtime floor: `>=20` (from `package.json`)
- Pi host expectations are documented from current peer dependencies rather than a tested pinned Pi version range
- the extension is source-loaded from `./extension/index.ts` through `package.json` `pi.extensions`
- the package exposes `.pi/skills` through `package.json` `pi.skills` for install-based global skill loading
- the shell CLI is exposed through `package.json` `bin.pi-dev-loops`
- the extension syncs packaged agent files (`.pi/agents/*.agent.md`) into `~/.agents/` on `session_start` so user-level agents are available outside this repo
- package install/update happens through `pi install` / `pi update`
- this phase does not yet claim a specific supported `gh` version; it only checks `gh` presence and authentication state
- this phase does not require a separate compiled build or `dist/` pipeline

Root verification and test commands are intentionally explicit:
- `npm run verify` is the canonical root verification path (`npm test` + `npm run test:dev-loop`)
- `npm test` runs the current root test suite (`test:assets`, `test:extension`, `test:scripts`, and `test:core`)
- `npm run test:extension`
- `npm run test:extension` currently expands to one `node --import tsx --test ...` invocation in `package.json`; prefer the script entrypoint over copying the file list into downstream docs or runbooks
- `npm run test:scripts`
- `npm run test:assets`
- `npm run test:dev-loop`
- `npm run test:playwright:viewer` remains an explicit viewer/browser smoke, not part of the default root verify path

## Design rule

Both wrappers should stay thin. Shared workflow mechanics should live in deterministic `packages/core/` modules and `scripts/`, not in extension-only or CLI-only command logic. Runtime command support that bridges both surfaces belongs in `lib/dev-loops-core.mjs`. See [Library vs Packages Core Boundary](../docs/lib-vs-packages-core-boundary.md) for the full ownership rule.
