# dev-loops

Turn GitHub issues into merged PRs with zero manual steps between issue and approval.

## What is a dev loop?

A dev loop is an AI-driven development cycle. It takes a GitHub issue through seven lifecycle phases — from intake to merge — with deterministic routing, self-correcting review gates, and autonomous execution until the human approval checkpoint.

**Lifecycle phases:**

| Phase | What happens |
|---|---|
| `issue_intake` | Normalize the issue, confirm scope, detect linked PRs |
| `refinement` | Elaborate spec, run bounded audit, harden acceptance criteria |
| `implementation` | Build the accepted scope on a feature branch or via Copilot |
| `draft_gate` | Gate review at the draft→ready boundary before marking PR ready |
| `feedback_resolution` | Fix, reply to, and resolve review threads on GitHub |
| `pre_approval_gate` | Final gate review: verify evidence, CI, and unresolved threads |
| `merge` | Merge the PR and write the retrospective checkpoint |

Each phase is consultable from the deterministic state model in `packages/core/src/loop/lifecycle-state.mjs`. The public routing contract is [Public Dev Loop Contract](./skills/docs/public-dev-loop-contract.md).

## Quick start

Use **`dev-loop`** as the single public workflow entrypoint:

- `start dev loop on issue 112` — start work on an issue
- `auto dev loop on issue 112` — autonomous execution until human approval
- `continue dev loop on PR 88` — continue follow-up on an open PR

The `dev-loop` entrypoint resolves authoritative state, picks the correct internal strategy, and routes work deterministically. Users never need to choose internal strategy names. See the canonical shorthand example mapping in the [Public Dev Loop Contract](./skills/docs/public-dev-loop-contract.md).

## Docker

A deterministic container image with all required tooling for dev-loop operation.

### Build

```bash
docker build -t dev-loops .
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose | Required for smoke test |
|---|---|---|
| `GH_TOKEN` | GitHub personal access token for `gh` CLI and API calls | Yes |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | LLM provider key (needed only when running `pi` / LLM-backed dev-loop operations) | No |

### Smoke test

Verify the image works with a minimal dev-loop info call:

```bash
docker run --rm -e GH_TOKEN="$GH_TOKEN" dev-loops dev-loops loop info --repo mfittko/pi-dev-loops --issue 1
```

### Toolchain verification

Check that all required tools are reachable:

```bash
docker run --rm dev-loops node --version
docker run --rm dev-loops pi --version
docker run --rm dev-loops dev-loops --version
docker run --rm dev-loops gh --version
docker run --rm dev-loops git --version
```

### Repeatable builds

The Dockerfile pins exact versions for Node.js (via base image), pi CLI, pi extensions, and gh CLI. Paired with the committed `package-lock.json`, repeat builds produce functionally identical toolchain versions.

### Runtime patterns

**Interactive Pi with host config (writable):**

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -e GH_TOKEN="$GH_TOKEN" \
  -v "$HOME/.pi:/home/node/.pi" \
  dev-loops pi
```

Shares sessions, models, settings. Container writes session logs to host `~/.pi`.

**Interactive Pi clean (no config sharing):**

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -e GH_TOKEN="$GH_TOKEN" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="$OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  dev-loops pi
```

Ephemeral `~/.pi` inside container. Provider auth via env vars.

**Full dev-loop with live repo worktree:**

```bash
git clone --mirror git@github.com:owner/repo.git /tmp/mirror
git --git-dir=/tmp/mirror worktree add /tmp/run /tmp/mirror/main

docker run -it --rm \
  -e GH_TOKEN="$GH_TOKEN" \
  -v "$HOME/.pi:/home/node/.pi" \
  -v /tmp/run:/workspace \
  dev-loops pi
```

Mounts live repo worktree over baked-in `/workspace`. One isolated Pi session per container.

## Workflow posture

- Use **`dev-loop`** as the single public façade for all routed work
- Prefer the GitHub-first path for active implementation and release work
- Use local implementation only when explicitly requested
- Internal routed logic stays behind the public façade

This repo is shared Pi workflow infrastructure built on generic role agents plus thin workflow entrypoint agents where needed. Thin workflow entrypoint agents are allowed when they only load a skill and defer policy to it.

Phase 8 is the active durable phase; Phase 7 second-repo pilot is deferred. See [Docs Index](./docs/index.md) for the full execution snapshot.

## Configuration

Gate review angles, refinement settings, persona mappings, and workflow defaults are config-driven via `.pi/dev-loop/defaults.yaml`. Consumer repos override values in `.devloops` at repo root (legacy `.pi/dev-loop/settings.yaml` still loads with a deprecation warning). The loader also accepts `.yml` and `.json` extensions and legacy `overrides.*` files as fallback formats. See [Extension Documentation](./extension/README.md) for details.

```bash
npx dev-loops gates   # see what reviewers will check
```

Key surfaces:
- **Gate angles** — which review lenses run at draft and pre-approval gates
- **Persona prompts** — focused instructions per angle (DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SRP, SoC, and more)
- **Refinement** — fan-out count and mode for parallel review variants
- **Autonomy** — which gates require operator confirmation
- **Workflow defaults** — retrospective enforcement, draft-first posture, dev-mode policy

Full details: [Extension Documentation](./extension/README.md) and `.pi/dev-loop/defaults.yaml`.

## Package surface

Install with:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/mfittko/pi-dev-loops          # global
pi install -l git:github.com/mfittko/pi-dev-loops       # project-local
```

Use `npx dev-loops` to run the CLI without installing. After a global `pi install`, the `dev-loops` command is available directly in your shell.

The package exposes the `/dev-loops` extension command surface, the `dev-loops` shell CLI, and packaged skills from `package.json` `pi.skills`.

See [Extension Documentation](./extension/README.md) for the full command and package-install contract.

## Requirements

- Node `>=20`
- `gh` installed and authenticated for GitHub/Copilot workflows
- `pi-subagents` for async workflow assumptions
- A Pi host that satisfies peer dependencies on `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` and `@mariozechner/pi-tui`

## Development

```bash
npm run verify   # canonical root verification (tests + dev-loop tests)
```

CI splits into a small changed-files gate plus parallel `verify` and conditional `viewer-smoke` jobs. `npm ci` + `npm run verify` run on every change, while the workspace-local Playwright WebKit cache and viewer smoke run only when files in the bounded inspect-run viewer surface or its smoke-path dependencies change.
